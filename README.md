# Meet App
A serverless, progressive web application (PWA) with React using a test-driven development (TDD) technique. This application uses the Google Calendar API to fetch upcoming events.

- Filter events by city
- Show/Hide event details
- Specify number of events
- Use the app when offline
- Add an app shortcut to home screen
- Display charts visualizing event details

### Feature 1: Filter events by city

I should be able to **use the app when offline**, <br />
So that **I have constant access to my events, and my use of the app is not limited to when I have internet access**.

### Feature 5: Add an app shortcut to home screen
As a **user**, <br />
I should be able to **add an app shortcut to home screen**, <br />

## Gherkin Syntax


#### Scenario 1 - User can select a city from the suggested list
**Given** user was typing "Berlin" in the city textbox AND the list of suggested cities is showing; <br />
**When** the user selects a city (eg "Berlin, Germany") from the list; <br />
**Then** their city should be changed to that city (ie "Berlin, Germany") AND the user should receive a list of upcoming events in that city.

#### Scenario 2 - User is viewing details of event
**Given** user is viewing a list of events; <br />
**When** the user selects "show details" link for event; <br />
**Then** detailed information for event should be displayed.

#### Scenario 3 - User can specify the number of events to be displayed
**Given** user is viewing upcoming events page; <br />
**When** the user selects the number of events (eg "20") to be displayed; <br />
**Then** the app view should update with the specified number of events (ie "20").

#### Scenario 4 - User has no internet access
**Given** user is wanting to use the app but is offline; <br />
**When** the user opens the app; <br />
**Then** the app should display cached event details and perform actions that don't require internet.

#### Scenario 5 - User wants to add app shortcut to their home screen
**Given** user is in the app settings; <br />
**When** the user selects "add to home screen"; <br />
**Then** app should deploy a shortcut to the app on user's device homescreen.

#### Scenario 6 - User wants to see how many events will take place in a certain location
**Given** user is on events page; <br />
**When** the user selects "chart" icon; <br />
**Then** a scatterplot will be displayed showing how many events will take place in each location.
